# Exercise 1: Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

## Objective
Implement and evaluate a binary classification model using logistic regression.

## Instructions
1. Load the provided binary classification dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis
3. Preprocess the data if necessary
4. Implement logistic regression using scikit-learn
5. Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics
6. Visualize the decision boundary (if applicable)

## Expected Deliverables
- Python script or Jupyter notebook with your solution
- Data exploration visualizations
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix, ROC curve
- Analysis of model performance

## Hints
- Use classification_report and confusion_matrix from sklearn
- Plot ROC curve and calculate AUC
- Consider feature scaling if needed
