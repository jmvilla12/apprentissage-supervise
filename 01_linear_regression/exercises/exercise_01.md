# Exercise 1: Simple Linear Regression

## Objective
Learn to implement and evaluate a simple linear regression model.

## Instructions
1. Load the provided dataset
2. Explore the data with visualizations
3. Implement linear regression using scikit-learn
4. Evaluate the model performance
5. Interpret the results

## Expected Deliverables
- Python script or Jupyter notebook with your solution
- Visualization of the data and regression line
- Model evaluation metrics
- Written interpretation of results

## Hints
- Use matplotlib or seaborn for visualizations
- Consider metrics like MSE, RMSE, and RÂ²
- Don't forget to split your data into training and testing sets
